The easiest way to compile the code is by using NVIDIA Nsight and
import the project from the archive file. In specific:

1) From the menu bar, choose File -> import...
2) Select "Project from archive" and find AKS_CUDA.zip
3) If Build project option does not work, try right click on the project and 
"clean project"
4) Rebuild

If NVIDIA Nsight is not available, you can find the Makefile that was 
generated by eclipse in AKS_CUDA/Debug/

- In command line, type "make"
